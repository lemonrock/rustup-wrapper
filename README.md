# rustup-wrapper

[rustup-wrapper] provides a set of pre-built rustup binaries for systems such as Linux Musl that the official rustup project does not yet support. It also includes the official rustup binaries, so providing a single place to look for.

* Pre-built binaries are in `dist`
* Binaries are built (or downloaded) using `build`
