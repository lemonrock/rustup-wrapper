# Make sure  rustc-wrapper,  rust.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.ar  and  rust.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.linker are on the PATH
# Replace  "/absolute/path/to/sysroot  (sic) with whatever path to a sysroot is in use
# rustc --target path/to/target.json 
# https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross is very useful
